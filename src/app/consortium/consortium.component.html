                <u>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e) </u> is a research-driven university of international standing, where
                excellent research and excellent education go hand in hand. TU/e focus on a balanced approach towards
                education, research and valorization of knowledge in the areas of engineering science and technology.
                It works in close collaboration with other universities, scientific institutes, social organizations,
                government, and industry.

                <u>Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan</u> (KTH) provides one-third of Sweden’s capacity for engineering studies and
                technical research at post-secondary level. KTH conducts top-notch education and research of a broad
                spectrum, from natural science to all branches of technology. KTH will be involved in the project through
                both the Department of Automatic Control (AC) and the Centre for Autonomous Systems (CAS), which have
                been participating in several EU and national projects.
