        Picture an environment where autonomous agents (robots, drones, cars) collaborate with humans fulfilling
        complex and dynamic changing tasks. To have real, sustainable autonomy, these agents need to obtain and
        improve adequate <b> situational awareness and actively perceive risks. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the purpose of  <b> Symbolic Logic Framework for Situational Awareness in Mixed Autonomy (SymAware),
        </b> a project funded by the European Union.
